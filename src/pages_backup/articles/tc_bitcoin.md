## Commercial Wallets

The recommended book, Mastering Bitcoin [^1]:, explores Bitcoin usage through a user, called Alice, who acquires some coinage from a friend and buys a cup of coffee with it. The book is conveying the technical dimensions of the purchase, but I can use this now proverbial example to clarify [the application of Bitcoin](/tutorials/bitcoin) to the Trade Control project.

To receive her first Bitcoin, Alice creates a new wallet to which she alone has the private keys. If only all her financial transactions could be from this wallet! She would no longer be reliant on the money-printing fiat currency of the banks, with Caesar’s head upon its coins. She would be a sovereign individual [^2]:. But is that true? Of all the transactions involved in trade, the financial transaction is the most trivial. In the accompanying article on [Production Systems](tc_production), I explain how trade works and how it maps onto the schema design. Sovereignty is a concept, but like all reality, it is underpinned by functions. Therefore, I can apply my theory of technological production to Alice’s Bitcoin purchase but on the trading side of the transaction.

Physical trade is a collaborative venture dependent upon [production](tc_production#production) and [organisation](tc_production#organisations), for without production there is nothing to trade and without organisation there are no [interfaces](tc_production#interfaces) to produce. This fundamental fact is encapsulated in my life-affirming [test for intelligence](tc_production#intelligence-test). The transactions that take place in production do so across spatial and temporal [workflows](tc_production#workflow). These naturally organise themselves into [Consumption](tc_production#consumption-networks) and [Production Networks](tc_production#production-networks). They do so because there are [rules of abstraction](tc_production#component-definition) that determine the production and consumption of a [subject’s projected interfaces](tc_production#subjects-and-objects). It is why the Trade Control node is recursive internally ([BOM Demonstration](/tutorials/manufacturing#bom-specification)) as well as externally between nodes ([Network Demonstration](/tutorials/network_overview)).

Bob’s Café serves Alice her beverage. There is then a Consumption Network that flows through the café: various kinds of beans shipped from coffee-growing regions around the globe, cow’s milk from the Dairy Industry, oat milk from Arable farming, sugar, and every other offering it sells, like the ingredients for its cakes or disposable straws. All the stuff that is consumed in the production of its interfaces, including utilities like water supply and electricity, or waste products like sewerage. But there must also be a Production Network to enable the café to deliver its product: the industrial coffee machines, the utensils, the ovens, fridges and sinks, the building itself and the infrastructure that supports it, as well as labour. Stuff not consumed in the act of production: tools that just wear out, by entropy or design; staff that come and go. Then there is the User Interface: the taste of the coffee, the snacks, the crockery, the furniture and décor, the quality of service, the location and clientele, the cost.

Bob’s Café is not building ships, but nevertheless it is connected to all the world. Although the café is an organisation, not an individual, it is sovereign, because only it can legislate the terms and conditions by which Alice gains access to its resource. Irrespective of the financial transaction, all the laws flow from the productive resource to the consumer. Poor Alice! She stands behind her Tor shield and wields her private keys, but for every trade and transaction (her rent or mortgage, her wages, insurance, student debt, all her online and offline shopping etc) she is a law taker (i.e. not sovereign). That is why the State must enact Consumer Protection Law to prevent socially aggravating levels of abuse. It is also why I have plugged Bitcoin directly into the supply-chain, on the other side of the looking glass.

## Ownership

Now Bitcoin has been [successfully mapped onto the Cash Account](https://tradecontrol.github.io/bitcoin), as UOA, we can ask the following question:

> Who owns this wallet and under what conditions?

Here are two pointers:

**A.**  A Bitcoin transaction is falsely presented as a double-entry book-keeping ledger entry:

| INPUT   | INPUT VALUE | OUTPUT   | OUTPUT VALUE |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Input 1 | 0.10 BTC    | Output 1 | 0.10 BTC     |
| Input 2 | 0.20 BTC    | Output 2 | 0.20 BTC     |

**B.**  The most sovereign individuals in the world live in [the City of Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco).
