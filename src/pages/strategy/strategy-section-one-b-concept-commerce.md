Trade Control models commerce not as a neutral exchange, but as a layered interface between production and financial abstraction. It separates this interface into two domains: **Industrial Capitalism**[^1], which orchestrates production through engineering and supply chains, and **Financial Capitalism**[^2], which territorialises rights through asset-layer projection.

## Industrial Capitalism and the Logic of Production

Industrial Capitalism emerged from the fusion of engineering workflows and market orchestration during the Industrial Revolution. It is defined by two mechanisms:

- **Workflow logic** – the application of science and engineering to produce functioning technology  
- **Supply-chain orchestration** – the commercial instruments that distribute and sell these technologies

This duality splits the market into two domains:

- **Goods and services** (Consumer Price[^3])  
- **Shares and stock** (Producer Price[^4])

Trade Control exposes the tension between these domains by modelling price discovery as a schema-native process. It reveals that:

- Consumer Price is derived from production cost and competitive margin, but conventional costing methods obscure this logic with asset-layer projections  
- Producer Price is discovered in the financial markets, where shares are traded without reference to production

To resolve this, Trade Control introduces **Gestalt Costing**[^5]—a schema-native method rooted in the Production Layer and Supply-and-Demand recording surface. It enables:

- Transaction-grained cost modelling  
- Real-time financial impact analysis  
- Recursive scheduling across supply-chains

Industrial Capitalism is not inherently exponential. It grows only when Consumer Price fails to finance innovation. Producer Price then steps in, creating a feedback loop of investment, extraction, and eventual deflation. This loop is finite, because it is tied to the limits of production.

## Financial Capitalism and the Logic of Extraction

Financial Capitalism is not a natural evolution of industrial logic—it is a negative feedback loop that extracts rights from production and concentrates them in the Asset Layer.

The turning point came in 1986 with the UK’s Big Bang, when the London Stock Exchange was deregulated and digitised. Sir Nicholas Goodison, then chairman, declared:

> “We must never lose sight of that prime purpose of a stock market, which is to serve industry…”

Instead, the LSE became a laboratory for financial instruments. Capital debt outstripped equity, and the industrial base was hollowed out.

Trade Control traces this transformation through three stages:

1. Demote infinite debt, promote finite debt (shares → bonds)  
2. Replace public with private capital (public stock → private equity)  
3. Return to gold (fiat currency → crypto currency)

Each stage reflects a deeper territorialisation of rights. Capital debt becomes a mechanism for ceaseless growth and extraction. The debtor must pay both principal and interest, siphoning capital from the balance sheet into the coffers of the creditor.

Banks, hedge funds, and asset managers are capitalist entities too. Their balance sheets are owned externally, and their capital is declared like any other. Financialisation is not neutral—it is a technique for enriching owners and their portfolios.

## Infinite Territory and the Violence of Projection

Money creation is not just debt issuance—it is territorial projection. Finite territory (property, land) bestows rights to legislate and extract. Infinite territory (the future) is created by issuing finite debt via fiat. Central banks inflate the money supply against this imagined future, but the burden eventually exceeds the bearing capacity of the present[^6].

Trade Control models this as a unitary projection—a force field that must be maintained through coercion. When debts can no longer be paid, the system defaults to violence: military force, plunder, or systemic collapse. The Production Layer, with its recursive workflows and ecological logic, is the opposite of this arrangement.

## Exodus and the Problem of Finitude

Even the vast derivatives and bond markets are ultimately credited against the Production Layer. Every tradable asset depends on capital that must be serviced through wages, which are liabilities. As financial markets are privatised, the many below the Asset Layer become indebted to the few above it—infinitely.

One endgame is a return to finitude[^7]: crypto replacing gold, rights reallocated through mathematically enforced scarcity. Trade Control does not endorse this nightmare—it models, exposes, and seeks alternatives rooted in productive agency.

## Summary

Trade Control separates commerce into industrial and financial domains, exposing the layered logic of production and extraction. It models price discovery, capital creation, and asset projection as schema-native processes. By calculating capital from a mentality that is not of it, Trade Control de-territorialises the financial interface and restores agency to production.
