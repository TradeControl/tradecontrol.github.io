### The ERP Seed and the Intelligence Test

Trade Control is not a legacy replacement. It’s a seed.

Planted in a Production Theory, it defines a new kind of ERP—[schema-native](/strategy/strategy-schema-native), polarity-aware, and recursive. It doesn’t simulate business logic. It expresses it. Every transaction is a declaration. Every balance is a traversal. Every cost is a signal.

The system was designed to invert conventional ERP logic:

- No journals  
- No double-entry  
- No procedural tax scripts  
- No modular silos

Instead, Trade Control models supply, demand, tax, and profit as declarative flows—fast, auditable, and structurally complete.

But the architecture is more than operational. It’s philosophical.

[Trade Control is a test-bed for intelligence](/strategy/strategy-intelligence-test). And here is an example of [how it can be applied](/strategy/strategy-section-two-example).

Not “Can you imitate a human?”  
But “Can you grow the seed to its full expression?”

Intelligence isn’t simulated—it’s demonstrated by projecting your own completion point, recursively, from inside the Production Layer. AI doesn’t just operate Trade Control. It passes through it.

> The schema is the proving ground.  
> The architecture is the test.
