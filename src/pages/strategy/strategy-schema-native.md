title: Strategy - What does schema-native mean?
permalink: /strategy/strategy-schema-native
---

**Schema-native** means the system’s logic is embedded directly in the data structure itself — not layered on top through procedural code, journals, or external workflows.

In Trade Control, this manifests as:

- **Declarative logic**: Categories define relationships; Cash Codes carry polarity, tax type, and jurisdiction
- **Tagged transactions**: Every entry declares its nature—no inference required
- **Recursive traversal**: Balances, tax, and profit are calculated by walking the structure
- **No procedural scripts**: The schema itself performs the logic
- **AI-ready**: Because the structure is rich with meaning, not just data

Legacy systems simulate accounting. Trade Control expresses it.
