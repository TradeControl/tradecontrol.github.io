## The Mentality Behind Markets

In conventional ERP systems, assets are treated as static entries—owned, valued, and traded across financial markets. This logic is not native to production. It is territorial: a mentality that flattens productive reality into tradable units. It emerged historically through land ownership, industrial capitalisation, and the rise of financial abstraction.[^1]

Trade Control exposes this mentality by modelling assets as schema-native projections, not static things. Assets are not intrinsic to production—they are derived, layered, and often coercive. The system can operate without them entirely, orchestrating workflows in pure production logic. But when asset logic is required—by law, by finance, by ownership—it is grafted on as a projection.

## Layered Capital Creation

Trade Control models capital creation as a layered process, with four distinct surfaces [^2]:

1. **Production Layer** – The recursive, multi-dimensional domain of tasks, jobs, and transformations.
2. **Recording Surface** – A schema-native surface for projecting asset charge, replacing DEBK.
3. **Capital Layer** – The balance sheet and P&L, constructed from transaction-grained logic.
4. **Asset Layer** – The external projection of ownership, enabling surplus extraction and investment.

Each layer transforms the previous, projecting value across time and space. This layering is not interpretive—it is embedded in the schema. The diagrams in the original article illustrate how capital is created, charged, and extracted through these surfaces.

## Unitary Interface Projection

Before assets can be owned, they must be projected. Trade Control makes this act explicit. The system models the Unitary Interface Projection[^3] —the mental act of territorialising productive space and time. This projection precedes ownership. It is the same mentality behind land deeds, company shares, and financial instruments.

In *The Odyssey*, Odysseus lands on Ithaca and doesn’t recognise it. Not because the land has changed, but because his interface with the world has shifted. Trade Control invokes this moment to show how economic systems operate: not by changing reality, but by changing how it is seen, mapped, and claimed.[^4]

## Asset Charge and Schema Logic

Instead of double-entry bookkeeping[^5], Trade Control applies Asset Charge directly to production statements. This creates a recording surface that reflects capital without concealing the underlying productive logic. Assets are charged, discharged, and revalued based on their role in production—not their market price.

Ownership is treated as a projection, not a static state. This allows recursive modelling of asset flows, where one node’s asset can be another’s liability. Real vs virtual, finite vs infinite, charged vs uncharged—these distinctions are schema-native, not interpretive.

## Inversion of Conventional Logic

In conventional systems, production logic evolved under the constraints of asset abstraction. Trade Control inverts this hierarchy. The Production Layer leads, and the Asset Layer follows. Capital is not a precondition—it is a projection. This inversion restores agency to the productive domain and breaks the spell of territorial logic.

## Redefining Money

Trade Control redefines money not as a store of value, but as an **Allocation of Rights**[^6]. Wealth is measured not by possession, but by agency:

- The right to produce, issued by the State across the Production Network (via Company Law)
- The right to consume, issued by the Owner across the Consumption Network (via Contract Law)

This reframing exposes the unitary projection at the heart of modern economics—a territorial force field that flattens productive reality into tradable abstraction. Trade Control breaks this spell by modelling money as a schema-native projection, recalculated with every transaction, and embedded in the logic of production itself.

## Commercial Crypto Wallet

The system includes a fully functional commercial Bitcoin wallet[^7], capable of trading over the blockchain network and generating instantaneous balance sheets and P&Ls. Technically, it works flawlessly. But economically, it has been rendered unusable—not by failure, but by success. The Satoshi, once a means of exchange, has been reterritorialized by the Financial Markets into an asset class. It no longer flows—it sits, speculates, and signals. It has become the ultimate cadastral[^8]: indexed, securitised, and abstracted from production.

Trade Control will revisit this integration. The goal is not to restore Bitcoin’s original promise, but to recontextualise its utility—to reconnect hard currency logic with productive agency, and to resist the territorialisation of rights by financial abstraction.

## Summary

Trade Control redefines assets as schema-native projections layered over production. It exposes the territorial logic of conventional ERP and offers a recursive model of capital creation that resists capture. By modelling asset charge, layered projection, and unitary interface logic, it transforms the ERP from a ledger into a living system—one where production speaks in its own voice, and ownership is no longer the Master of Design.
