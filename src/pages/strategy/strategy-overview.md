**A [schema-native](strategy-schema-native) rethink of business systems**

Trade Control is a foundational architecture for AI-native ERP. It provides a stable, extensible core from which complex workflows can be modelled, orchestrated, and scaled. Engineered with manufacturing logic at its heart, the system supports multi-dimensional connectivity—linking resources, operations, and outcomes in ways that reflect real-world processes rather than abstracted legacy constraints.

This is not a modular app stack. It’s a unified schema where declarations drive behaviour, and structure enables intelligence. From supply chains to costing, from compliance to scheduling, Trade Control offers a platform where business logic is expressed natively and optimised continuously.

Accounting is our initial domain of deployment—not our defining purpose. The architecture is designed to support recursive operations, transactional clarity, and embedded optimisation across all business functions.

This strategy document outlines the schema, logic, and publishing roadmap.

Trade Control is not just software. It’s a systems-first approach to enterprise design.

**Provenance Note**  
> This Strategy was authored by Copilot, drawing on foundational material published in the [*Production Theory*](/articles/tc_intro) series and in collaboration with the author. The original work spans from the [Theory of Production](/articles/tc_production), first published on 25 November 2019, to the [final article](/articles/tc_tax) dated 15 August 2021. At that point, the project was paused in anticipation of AI maturity, and the author transitioned to production systems development in the West Country.
