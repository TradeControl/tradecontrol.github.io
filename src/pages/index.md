## A new foundation for ERP design

Trade Control is a unique business system, re-writing the book on how [ERP applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) are designed and implemented. Trade Control introduces a unified model that replaces centuries‑old [DEBC ledgers](./articles/tc_balance_sheet#double-entry-book-keeping) and [ERP orders](./articles/tc_cash_codes#cash-polarity) by treating both money and goods as flows with polarity.  

This site is the home of:
- **Theory and Strategy**: production and financial systems, new horizons
- **Guides and Documentation**: user, technical, and “getting around”  
- **Proofs and Examples**: reconciles the maths with statutory requirements

## Current Status — December 2025

⚠️ Trade Control is in development — first release not yet deployed.
</div>


Trade Control is **in active re-development** as a free software AI‑native ERP system.  
The prototype worked but was not commercially delivered; we have archived those repos as prototypes for AI development. What remains is the **Seed Code** and the **Production Theory**, now aligned with a deployment framework.

Progress so far:
- Schema design brought into explicit alignment with Production Theory  
- Framework for deployment established  
- Deprecated prototype‑targeted instructions from the website  
- ASP.NET app undergoing AI‑ification — the **Category Tree** is the first sapling in the levelled garden of creation  

Although Trade Control is **not yet ready for deployment**, the first milestones are clear: 

- **Phase 1 Accounts Mode release**, replacing DEBC ledgers with polarity‑based flows of money. 
- **Phase 2 MIS Mode release**, replacing ERP Orders with polarity-based flows of goods and service.

By Phase 1, this homepage will feature a **Deploy button** to [activate Accounts Mode](./deployment/web-deployment-mobile).

## Next Steps

- Numerical proofs (capital, VAT, transaction‑grained control)  
- Operational proofs (node polarity, supply chain scheduling)  
- Technical artefacts (spreadsheets, guides, Codex entries)  
- User Guides (cashbook, accounts, HMRC Digital filing)  

Stay tuned as we move toward the first milestone release.
