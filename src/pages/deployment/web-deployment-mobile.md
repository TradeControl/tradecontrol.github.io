This guide is for small business owners who want to deploy Trade Control Web quickly and easily, without technical setup or accountancy overhead.

## Overview

Trade Control Web supports **one-click deployment** directly from your mobile browser. Once deployed, the app connects to a secure database and loads the homepage. From there, you proceed to [Initialisation](web-initialisation), where you enter your business identity and start trading.

No servers, no downloads, no configuration files—just tap and go.

2. Tap the **Deploy** button.
3. Wait a few moments while the system provisions your business node.
4. Once the homepage loads, enter your email and password to register.
5. You’ll be assigned the **Administrator role** automatically.
6. Proceed to the Initialisation form to complete setup.

> Tip: You can re-run the Initialisation form anytime from the System menu if you want to start over or explore tutorials.
