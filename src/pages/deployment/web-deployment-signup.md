## Join the Hosted Community

Trade Control will soon offer hosted deployment — a simple way to run your ERP tools without managing infrastructure.
This option is ideal for small teams who want to get started quickly, with updates and support handled for you.
When ready, you’ll be able to sign up, configure your workspace, and deploy with a single click.

> Deployment is not yet available, but the hosted environment is being prepared. Stay tuned.

## Host in Your Own Cloud

Prefer to run Trade Control in your own environment?
We’ll provide everything you need to deploy the app in your own cloud — including container images, configuration templates, and setup guides.
This option gives you full control over your infrastructure while keeping the ERP logic intact.

> Self-hosted deployment will be documented once the hosted version is live.
