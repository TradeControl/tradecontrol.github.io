Trade Control Web supports multi-tenant hosting, allowing multiple businesses to run securely on shared infrastructure. This guide explains how to join the hosted community and start trading—without needing an Azure account or technical setup.

🌐 Ready to join? Visit the [Multi-Tenant Hosting Portal](https://tradecontrol.github.io/signup) to create your business node.

Includes:
- Automatic updates
- Secure hosting
- Usage-based pricing

## Overview

Each business gets its own secure node, with isolated data and full access to all system features. You don’t need to manage servers, databases, or updates—everything is handled for you.

## What You Get

- Full access to all Trade Control features
- Automatic updates as new functionality is released
- Secure data isolation per business node
- No Azure account required
- Simple monthly pricing based on usage

## Pricing

Most small businesses use less than 100MB of data. Hosting costs are modest, and pricing reflects actual usage:

- **Typical cost**: £5/month
- **Larger businesses** may pay more if usage increases
- **No feature gating** — all users get full functionality

## How It Works

1. Tap **Deploy** from the homepage
2. Choose **Join the Hosted Community**
3. Enter your email and password to register
4. You’ll be assigned the **Administrator role**
5. Proceed to the [Initialisation form](web-initialisation) to set up your business

Your node is provisioned instantly, and you can start trading within minutes.

## Why Choose Multi-Tenant Hosting?

- No technical setup
- No Azure subscription required
- Automatic upgrades as the platform evolves
- Scales with your business — from sole trader to manufacturer

You can migrate to a self-hosted deployment later if needed, but most users find the hosted model ideal for simplicity and growth.
