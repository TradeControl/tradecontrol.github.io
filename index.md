#### Everything you need to run your business successfully

## Purpose

- Share with the community a free, practical alternative to [conventional MIS]({{ site.url }}/about) and accountancy implementations.
- Deliver a [new business framework]({{ site.url }}/app) that is resistant to fraud whilst enabling fine-grained global visibility at transaction level speeds.
- Express the commercial architecture of the business entity as a recursive node, facilitating [supply-chain scheduling]({{ site.url }}/network).
- Optionally introduce a crypto-currency [Unit of Account]({{ site.url }}/bitcoin) into the industrial landscape.  
- Demonstrate a working version of a global trading platform by integrating [bitcoin](https://bitcoincore.org/) with the [ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki) world computer.

## Scalable Solution

The Trade Control core algorithms are implemented in Azure Sql, which can be scaled to any practical degree. The network interfaces are coded in c#. These are P2P networks, and hence global in their extent.

## Free Software

Trade Control is published under the GNU licence. You are free to engage with the code and extend functionality without permission. As a first-generation app, you can incorporate new developments without additional cost. There are no subscription fees.

## Implementation

The functionality of Trade Control has been materialised and tested in live environments.

If you would like to set up a working environment or evaluate the system for use in your own business, please [contact us]({{ site.url }}/contact) for more information.
