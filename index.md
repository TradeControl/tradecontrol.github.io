## ASP.NET Core Web App

For businesses that just want to eliminate accountancy fees using their mobile phones, a [secure web interface]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/installing-web) can be accessed from any device or browser. There is a richer presentation when accessing data via a tablet or workstation, but the functionality is identical.

Your existing website may be compatible. However, web service providers offer ASP.NET Core specific services starting at 1 GBP pcm. You can also install into Azure App Services on Linux and Azure SQL, enabling you to interact with your business data from both the web or 365.

## Scalable Solution for Office 365

You can begin with a free [local single-user installation]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/installing-local), then grow into a multi-user environment. The Trade Control core algorithms can be implemented in Azure Sql, scalable to any practical degree. The network interfaces are coded in c#. These are P2P networks, and hence global in their extent. Windows Virtual Desktop installed in Azure supports hundreds of users. 

## Free Software

Trade Control is published under the GNU licence. You are free to engage with the code and extend functionality without permission. You can therefore incorporate new developments without additional cost. There are no subscription fees.
