## Production

Although Trade Control is a generic MIS, it is at root a Production System.  That means it accepts inputs in the form of materials, components or services and transforms them through workflow into the desired product output. How that is implemented can be learnt from the [Bill of Materials tutorial]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/manufacturing).

When you take the first brave step to set up your own business, apply those hard-found skills in your area of expertise, you are not initially interested in the asset value of your business. This is what you get from conventional accounts. Instead, you want to manage workflows, establish job profitability and know the projected health of all on-going operations. You may be able to buy bolt-on modules, but the accounts are not derived from them. Here, that is not the case. 

## Manufacturing

Trade Control Ltd owns the IPO of a comprehensive manufacturing control system, developed in the factories of England, most of which are now gone. The continued financialisation of our economy has decimated the productive capacity of the country in which the Industrial Revolution was born. It is doubtful that the British economy has sufficient buoyancy in this area to support the release of an experimental system.
	
However, there are features in the schema design that should appeal to manufacturers, such as the ability to easily plug nodes together [into supply chains]({{ site.url }}/network); job costing based on dynamic product mixes and a transaction-grained projected company balance; and the clear model of workflow that does not need to distinguish between sales, purchase, maintenance or works orders to accurately model production.

Some of the modules authored and currently owned by Trade Control are:

- Stock control for materials, components, finished products and tooling
- Estimating and BOM Configurator
- Infinite MRPI scheduling
- Finite Gantt-based scheduling
- Tool management
- Shop floor documentation - route cards, instructions etc
- Quality control, Contract Review and performance recording (PPM etc)
- Serial tracking from good-inwards to delivery
- Automated Weigh Station counting and despatch
- IOT enabled Programmable Logic Controllers for direct machine monitoring
- Real-time alerts for cycle time performance, scrap and stoppages

There are placeholders inside the [Trade Control node]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/installing-sqlnode) for the connection of these manufacturing system modules. It is hoped that in time they can be re-connected and released into the public domain as free Open Source software.
