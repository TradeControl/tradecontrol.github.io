## Origins

Although Trade Control may be able to generate your company accounts, it does not come from the financial services sector, but rather the British Manufacturing Industry.
The design has been created by applying manufacturing system control techniques to the general problem of managing cash and business activity.  The result is a generic tool that provides real-time information regarding overall business performance and project management.  It is an alternative to asset-based accounting systems which have been designed by accountants to support double entry book-keeping and the legal obligation to present accounts. 

Trade Control initially deploys the methods of Systems Engineering to satisfy the needs of production and work; subsequently, money is mapped onto these processes using a principle of [cash polarity]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/cash-codes#cash-polarity).  Double-entry book-keeping error checks by balancing ledgers. Trade Control error checks against a cash account in the UOA of the presiding jurisdiction. There are many innovative advantages to this direct connection between money and productive workflows. Some of these have already been materialised:

- workflow modelling
- supply-chain scheduling
- Fraud-resistance
- transaction-grained forward balance sheets
- production schedule job costing
- crypto-currency UOA
