## Design

Broadly, the app connects two aspects of commerce: production and finance. It achieves this by modelling the business entity as [a productive node]({{ site.url }}/network), where inputs match outputs. [Workflows]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/manufacturing#workflow) are then mapped onto the value-chain using [cash polarity]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/cash-codes#cash-polarity).

Accounting systems are not connected to production because they use Double-Entry Book-Keeping ledgers to derive the accounts. They are asset-based, whilst Trade Control is production-based. It models workflows and money in terms of the familiar Supply and Demand.  From this alternative recording system, an asset-charge algorithm is subsequently applied to derive the company accounts. This is the opposite way round to traditional practice, where the objective is to establish asset value in the form of capital. Any production system must therefore be subsequently bolted on. In this way, production is disconnected from finance, increasing complexity and negatively influencing innovative potential.

## Origins

Although Trade Control may be able to generate your company accounts, it does not come from the financial services sector, but rather the British Manufacturing Industry.
The design has been created by applying manufacturing system control techniques to the general problem of managing cash and business activity.  The result is a generic tool that provides real-time information regarding overall business performance and project management.  It is an alternative to asset-based accounting systems which have been designed by accountants to support double entry book-keeping and the legal obligation to present accounts. 

There are many innovative advantages to this direct connection between money and productive workflows. Some of these have already been materialised:

- workflow modelling
- supply-chain scheduling
- fraud-resistance
- transaction-grained forward balance sheets
- production schedule job costing
- crypto-currency UOA
