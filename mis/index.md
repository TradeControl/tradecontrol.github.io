#### Scalable MIS that can interconnect to form supply-chains

## Why use the MIS?

The [Accounts Mode]({{ site.url }}/accounts) allows you to enter your own Company Accounts into the government portal, saving you on accountancy fees. It also relates your current and historical cash position, and ongoing profits. You can email invoices to customers and suppliers, raise credit notes and the like. All useful stuff, but it does not answer many common questions that always arise in a commercial setting, such as:

- how much money did I make on that job?
- can I afford to buy the materials for the order at a given time?
- what price should I quote the customer?
- what is my current order book and how will it impact finances?
- what operations need carrying out today?
- how do I communicate order requirements and specifications to third parties?
- what type of service or quantity of material will be needed to fulfil the schedule?
- when do materials need to arrive or services start?
- what future expenses must I register to project a forward company balance?

These kinds of questions can only be answered by using the project management tools. The Accounts Mode uses the MIS algorithms, simply removing workflows from the interface. Therefore, to activate, just re-connect the data source and select **Connect to MIS**. Consult the tutorials for [services]({{ site.url}}/tutorials/services) and [manufacturing]({{ site.url}}/tutorials/manufacturing) for ideas on how to apply this new functionality in your own business.
