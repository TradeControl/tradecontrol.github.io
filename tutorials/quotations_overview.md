## Price Lists

Whilst it is possible to contruct an xml file in a text editor, it is not very convenient, especially if you are storing images. There is an [xml generation app]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/pricelists) that allows you to easily create price list files, add your logo, product images and terms.
