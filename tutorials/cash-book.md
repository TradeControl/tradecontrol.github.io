title: Cash Book Accounting and Invoices 
permalink: /tutorials/cash-book
---

Every business must keep a cash book. This book is normally given to an accountant who prepares the accounts using double-entry book-keeping (DEBK). Trade Control replaces DEBK with Supply and Demand (SvD), applying an asset charge algorithm to derive the accounts directly from the books. You can then enter the results into the [government portal]({{ site.url }}/accounts#tax-law) in the same way as you do for your self-assessment.

This tutorial explains how to maintain your cash book, raise invoices and email them. Monthly balance sheets are automatically created as you go along, but corporations are likely to need a more sophisticated way to establish capital value. For this, also follow the tutorial on [generating a balance sheet]({{ site.url}}/tutorials/balance-sheet).
