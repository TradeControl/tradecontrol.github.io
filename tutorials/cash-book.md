> Tutorial under construction...

Every business must keep a cash book. This book is normally given to an accountant who prepares the accounts using double-entry book-keeping (DEBK). Trade Control replaces DEBK with Supply and Demand (SvD), applying an asset charge algorithm to derive the accounts directly from the books. You can then enter the results into the [government portal]({{ site.url }}/accounts#tax-law) in the same way as you do for your self-assessment.

This tutorial explains how to maintain your cash book, raise invoices and email them. Monthly balance sheets are automatically created as you go along, but it likely that you will need a more sophisticated way to establish capital value. For this, follow the tutorial on [generating a balance sheet]({{ site.url}}/tutorials/balance-sheet).

## Requirements

[installation]({{ site.url}}/tutorials/installing-local)

## Menu

When you log onto the system for the first time, you will be presented by the [System Admin](#administration) form. Right click on the Company Logo and insert a bitmap, pasting in your image.  Assuming you entered the correct details during the installation, you can accept these values without review. You are presented with the Home screen:

You will notice that there are not very many buttons on the menu. The reason for that is the way Trade Control models workflows. It classifies transactions by cash polarity rather than by actors and actions, such as customers and sales or credit notes and purchase invoices. Although not essential, understanding how this works will help you navigate the system effectively:
