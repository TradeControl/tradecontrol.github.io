Tutorials are classified into four sections:

- [Installation](#installation)
- [User guide](#user-guide)
- [Features](#features)
- [Experimental](#experimental)

## Services

Whilst you can follow the Installation Instructions yourself, setting up a multi-user application can be involved. Please [contact us]({{ site.url }}/contact) for assistance.

Working through the User Guide tutorials will give you a good understanding of how the system works. When applying this knowledge to your own business processes, it is important to configure the settings correctly from the outset. We provide guidance for setting up [cash classifications]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/cash-codes) and [activities]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/services#activities-and-workflow).

The Features section includes a sample Business Intelligence analysis for sales. Companies often have very different BI requirements. We can generate any kind of custom reporting services you need from the trading and financial data. We also set up your price lists for distribution to customers via our [quotation app]({{ site.url }}/quotation).

The Experimental tutorials cover supply-chain scheduling and bitcoin as UOA. Of the two, the first is the most likely candidate for implementation currently. If you would like to link up your order book with one or more suppliers and customers, we will help you implement the technology to facilitate that.
