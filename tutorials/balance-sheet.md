It is a statutory requirement for all companies to submit both a P&L and Balance Sheet to the government. Trade Control can generate legally compliant, auditable versions of both. Because it is not a statutory requirement to be represented by a chartered accountant, it is possible to present these documents yourself.  The following tutorial shows you how to prepare your balance sheet so that you can do this.
